# Abstract

As groundwater is an essential and over-utilized resource in dry climates like the Western United States, responsibly managing this resource becomes crucial for sustainability. Past studies have analyzed the connection between groundwater resources and surface land use, particularly in studies relating to recharge. A study performed in the Central Valley of California compiled and organized a list of wells with groundwater level measurements throughout the area. This dataset will first be analyzed to determine the rate at which groundwater levels in the region are declining (or rising), accounting for seasonal variations. Areas of rising or declining groundwater levels within the region will then be analyzed to determine if there is a connection between groundwater levels and land usage.
