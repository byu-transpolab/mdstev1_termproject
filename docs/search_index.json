In-situ groundwater level data are often inconsistent, which makes temporal analysis difficult. There are many interpolation methods that can be used to fill in gaps in datasets. Evans, Williams, Jones, Ames, and Nelson (2020) demonstrated an effective imputation method for groundwater data, utilizing an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). This study will explore the effectiveness of this approach in the Central Valley of California, an extremely productive agricultural area facing groundwater depletion challenges. A study compiled by NASA Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) compiled a robust dataset of in-situ groundwater level data in the Central Valley. This dataset will be analyzed for appropriate test areas and wells to compare the efficacy of the ELM method in this region against the kriging spatial interpolation method. Scanlon et al.
