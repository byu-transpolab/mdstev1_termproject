# Introduction {#intro}


A study performed by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) compiled data entries from over a million wells in the central valley. From this list, representative wells (with a sufficient amount of measurements) were chosen for 1-km grids across the valley. This dataset includes water table elevations at each well, measured across varying amounts and intervals of time. 

In this study, these measurements will be analyzed to determine if water levels are rising or falling. To account for seasonal variations, the measurements from each well will be analyzed across several years.
